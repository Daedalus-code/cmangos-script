#### What's the purpose of this tool?  
This tool introduce helping functions and features for admins running a WoW Vanilla server. 
#### How do you get it to work?
##### First time install
```mkdir /scripts/```  
```cd /scripts/```  
```git pull https://github.com/Daedalus-code/cmangos-script.git```  
```cp /scripts/cmangos-script/mangos /usr/local/bin```  
```sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mangos```  

You will be able to start 'mangos' from anywhere in terminal now.  

mangos script will look for config files inside /scripts/  
You need to copy config files from cmangos-script folder into /scripts/ folder.  

```cp /scripts/cmangos-script/config.* /scripts/```  

Edit config file 'config.cnf' with MySQL credentials.   
Edit config file 'config.txt' with correct information.  
#### Your own directory for configs?  
Edit mangos script at line 30:    
```source /scripts/server.txt # please edit if wrong.```  
server.txt at line 41:  
```folder_helper="/scripts/cmangos-script" # please edit if wrong.```  
server.txt at line 52:  
```sql_mycnf="/scripts/server.cnf" # please edit if wrong.```  
#### Updating/Upgrading Admin Helper  
"update Helper" will "install" mangos into /usr/local/bin and chmod it.  
There will be made a mangos.old version next to it. (non executable)  

The updater will install automatically if any changes and then exit.  
If there is no new changes you will be asked if you want to Install regardless.  
#### Planned Features  
* Time will tell.
